# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ryan Flannery! 
ðŸš€ Game Developer | Software Engineer | Open to Full Stack Opportunities

ðŸŒŸ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Flannery, a full-stack developer and game developer with a strong foundation in backend development. I specialize in designing interactive applications and immersive games with a focus on efficiency and user engagement, using tools like Python, JavaScript, C#, C++, SQL, and Java. My toolkit includes Unity, React, Node.js, Express, AWS, MySQL, MongoDB, and Keras, along with Postman and REST for API development. I'm passionate about building engaging gameplay experiences, optimizing backend systems, and contributing to impactful open-source projects. Whether itâ€™s designing innovative game mechanics or engineering reliable web solutions, Iâ€™m committed to delivering polished, user-centered results.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Joystick Journal, a collaborative web application project with a team of six developers. I lead and manage both the frontend and backend development, ensuring seamless integration and functionality. The application is built using a stack of Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS for the frontend, and TypeScript with Express.js, Node.js, and MySQL for the backend.

Joystick Journal is designed as a platform for users to interact and review games based on their experiences. It also provides personalized game recommendations for users who are curious about gaming but unsure what to play. Right from the homepage, users can explore games categorized by genre, discover highly-rated or low-rated games, and check out the latest releases.

We are focused on implementing key features like user registration, login with authentication, and designing a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing interface. Once completed, we plan to host the application on Vercel. This project highlights my ability to coordinate a team, build full-fledged backend functionalities, and create visually appealing and efficient web solutions.
